      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Coil is the central figure of the Limitless universe. A survivor of a multiversal war, he carries the burden of witnessing countless versions of his friends die. As the creator of this universe, he uses his powers not to control, but to protect and rebuild what was lost. His journey is deeply tied to memory, grief, and rebuilding trust—especially with those closest to him.</p>

He hides his pain well and often masks vulnerability with determination or silence. He can be emotionally distant at times, but his core is protective and warm.</p>
