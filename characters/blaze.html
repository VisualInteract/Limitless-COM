      <h2>Powers & Abilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Momentum Charge:</strong> Blaze builds up power the longer and faster he moves, storing it to unleash enhanced abilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Disruption Pulse:</strong> Sends out a kinetic shockwave that scrambles tech and focus in a short radius.</li>
        <li><strong>Adrenaline Surge:</strong> Boosts allies’ reaction speed and energy, making them hyper-focused and quick for a limited time.</li>
        <li><strong>Momentum Overdrive (Ultimate):</strong> Unleashes all stored kinetic energy in explosive moves—shockwave slams, sonic-speed punches, or a volatile escape burst.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>His combat style is all about keeping pressure high and never staying still. He’s hard to hit, harder to corner, and always brings chaos with a smile.</p>

      <h2>Relationships</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Coil:</strong> Blaze respects Coil’s leadership but often challenges his slower, cautious methods. The two have strong synergy once they sync up.</li>
