      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Dylan is a variant of Coil from a divergent timeline—a version shaped by rage, grief, and relentless survival. Though he shares Coil’s core essence, Dylan is more impulsive, emotional, and confrontational. Despite his rough demeanor, he has a strong moral compass and is often the first to jump in to defend those in danger.</p>

      <h2>Powers & Abilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reality Shards:</strong> Dylan wields fragmented pieces of multiversal code, using them to defend, attack, or warp logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Overdrive State:</strong> When enraged or cornered, Dylan's power surges uncontrollably, granting immense strength at the cost of control.</li>
        <li><strong>Empathic Sync:</strong> Dylan can connect emotionally with others, sensing hidden pain or fear—though this often overwhelms him.</li>
      </ul>
