      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Blue has white skin, a sturdy build, and wears a <strong>tin pot</strong> as a hat. His messy white tuft of hair sticks out from beneath the pot. He wears a grey hoodie with a tin pot decal on it, black pants, and headphones around his neck. A bandage wraps around his right arm—likely from battle wounds. His expression is usually a relaxed <code>-_-</code>, but don't let that fool you—he's full of energy.</p>

He often acts as the group's morale booster, cracking jokes and staying cool under pressure. Though chill and relaxed on the outside, he's got a huge heart and will stand by his friends no matter what.</p>
